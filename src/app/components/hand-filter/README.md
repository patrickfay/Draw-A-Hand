# Hand-Filter Component

The `hand-filter` component will hold some decent logic that will prob need to be reogranized. Woohoo can't wait!!

This component will allow the user to select a size for a hand of cards and will ask the user to select a card.

This comoponent will pass values chosen by the user to the parent component, which is where the view's data will be held.
